# CCR Full Debug 2026-05-01 — Report

Branch/worktree: `codex/ccr-full-debug-20260501` at `<operator-worktree>/ccr-full-debug-20260501/worktree`
Base: `origin/main` d2e07c3
Current head after this report refresh: `this commit`

## Branch-safety forensics

Source checkout `<operator-main-checkout>` was not edited. Work was performed only in the isolated worktree.

- Before worktree creation: source checkout was divergent from `origin/main` and left untouched.
- Isolated worktree was created from latest `origin/main` on branch `codex/ccr-full-debug-20260501`.
- A generated `fixtures/6597bb.json` scratch VCR fixture was inspected. It contained only synthetic unauthenticated print-mode output and was removed; no ignore rule was added because no tracked source fixture set exists at that path.
- Phase B plugin/auth CLI tests route test fixture writes into temp HOME so they do not regenerate root-level `fixtures/` scratch files.

## Changed files

- `src/utils/Shell.ts` — exported `shellSingleQuote` from the capitalized Shell utility module so Linux/Bun build resolution can satisfy imports that resolve to `Shell.ts`.
- `src/utils/Shell.test.ts` — regression test proving `shellSingleQuote` exists from `./Shell.js` and escapes POSIX single quotes.
- `src/utils/ripgrep.ts` / `src/utils/ripgrep.test.ts` — system `rg` fallback for source checkouts without vendored ripgrep.
- `src/services/compact/__tests__/autoCompact.test.ts` — isolates `NODE_ENV` for compaction config tests.
- `src/utils/featureFlag.ts`, `src/utils/__tests__/featureFlag.test.ts`, `src/services/flagHealth/flagHealth.ts`, `src/services/flagHealth/__tests__/flagHealth.test.ts` — explicit feature flag scan sources and env override coverage.
- `src/query/__tests__/query.test.ts` — app state mock now includes hook state needed by query permission tests.
- `scripts/__tests__/dense-rar-evidence-boundaries.test.ts` — accepts absent local planning evidence while keeping tracked publishable surfaces mandatory.
- `src/cli/handlers/plugins.ts` — rejects `plugin list --available` unless `--json` is also requested, matching the option contract and avoiding silent no-op human output.
- `tests/plugin-cli.test.ts` — temp-HOME CLI parity coverage for `plugin list --json` and the `--available`/`--json` contract.
- `tests/auth-cli.test.ts` — temp-HOME CLI parity coverage for unauthenticated `auth status` JSON default and `--text` output; idempotent credential-free logout; and login selector validation before OAuth startup.
- `src/utils/settings/settings.test.ts` — subprocess-isolated settings source parity coverage for user/project/local/flag precedence and `--setting-sources` filtering while preserving flag settings.
- `src/utils/permissions/__tests__/toolRestrictions.test.ts` — subprocess-isolated tool restriction parity coverage for `--tools`, default tool preset, and allowed/disallowed tool-list parsing.
- `src/tools.ts` — tool enablement checks now fail closed when a tool's `isEnabled()` throws, so unauthenticated/default-preset restriction setup does not crash before the auth gate.
- `.planning/phases/ccr-full-debug-20260501/PARITY-MATRIX.md` — official/CCR parity map.
- `.planning/phases/ccr-full-debug-20260501/FEATURE-FLAGS.md` — disabled feature/stub inventory.
- `.planning/phases/ccr-full-debug-20260501/REPORT.md` — this handoff report.

## Final verification checkpoint

- Plugin RED: `bun test tests/plugin-cli.test.ts` failed before the plugin fix because `plugin list --available` exited 0 without JSON.
- Plugin GREEN focused: `bun test tests/plugin-cli.test.ts`: PASS, 2 pass, 0 fail.
- Auth focused: `bun test tests/auth-cli.test.ts`: PASS, 4 pass, 0 fail.
- Settings focused: `bun test src/utils/settings/settings.test.ts`: PASS, 2 pass, 0 fail.
- Tool restriction RED: `bun test src/utils/permissions/__tests__/toolRestrictions.test.ts` initially failed because `getToolsForDefaultPreset()` evaluated unauthenticated `WebSearchTool.isEnabled()` and threw a required-auth-env error before restriction setup could complete.
- Tool restriction GREEN focused: `bun test src/utils/permissions/__tests__/toolRestrictions.test.ts`: PASS, 3 pass, 0 fail.
- Tool registry/restriction focused: `bun test tests/tools-registry.test.ts src/utils/permissions/__tests__/toolRestrictions.test.ts`: PASS, 7 pass, 0 fail.
- `bun run build`: PASS. Bundle output: `cli.js` about 27.15 MB.
- `bun test`: PASS. 2246 pass, 1 skip, 0 fail, 5506 expect calls, 154 files.
- `bun run src/entrypoints/cli.tsx --help >/tmp/ccr-help.txt`: PASS. 68 help lines; first line is `Usage: dash-shatter [options] [command] [prompt]`.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- Compact privacy scan over branch-touched public docs/reports/source: PASS. Checked for raw key-shaped strings, private endpoints, private overlay-network details, and operator-local absolute paths.
- Independent reviewer subagent attempt during plugin fix: blocked by provider quota (HTTP 429), so no external reviewer verdict was available. Static scan and full verification passed locally.
- `fixtures/`: clean. Root-level scratch fixture was removed and was not regenerated.

## Parity status summary

Confirmed parity:
- Core `--help` works after dependencies are installed.
- `--version` works from earlier checkpoint.
- Major official CLI flags are present in CCR help: print, output format, model, permission modes, tools, settings, bare, worktree, update/install, auth, mcp, plugins, agents.
- `plugin list --json` returns machine-readable JSON with clean temp HOME/no installed plugins.
- `auth status` defaults to JSON and exits non-zero when unauthenticated.
- `auth status --text` prints a human unauthenticated message and exits non-zero.
- `auth logout` is regression-covered as idempotent and credential-free in temp HOME.
- `auth login --console --claudeai` is regression-covered to fail before any OAuth/browser flow.
- Settings source merge precedence is regression-covered for user -> project -> local -> flag settings, including deep object merge and permission rule array concatenation.
- `--setting-sources` behavior is regression-covered for filtering user/project/local sources while still preserving always-on `--settings` flag input.
- `--tools` behavior is regression-covered for exposing only requested built-in tools to the model tool list without requiring auth during restriction setup.
- `--allowed-tools` and `--disallowed-tools` comma/space parsing is regression-covered, including Bash rule contents.

Improved in Phase B:
- `plugin list --available` now fails fast unless `--json` is present, matching its documented option contract.
- Auth status unauthenticated behavior is now regression-covered with temp HOME and scrubbed auth env.

Partial parity:
- Print mode reaches auth gate but cannot complete without credentials.
- Auth login/logout flows, MCP, plugins interactive UI, permissions UI, slash commands, worktree, bare mode, context loading, and deeper permission-mode behavior need focused behavioral tests.

Not implemented or not exposed compared with current official docs:
- `claude project purge [path]`.
- `claude remote-control` / `--remote-control` / `--rc` surface.
- `claude ultrareview [target]`.
- `claude auto-mode defaults/config`.
- Full current slash-command ecosystem not yet proven.

## Feature-flag summary

- 993 `feature(...)` call sites found.
- 72 unique flag strings found.
- `feature()` is still globally false in the reverse-engineered entrypoint, so feature-gated code remains disabled.
- No broad feature restoration was done. Core CLI parity/build/test reliability took priority.
- Highest-risk disabled groups: permission classifiers/auto mode, remote bridge/control, proactive scheduling, subagent fork/coordinator, native voice/computer-use surfaces.

## Residual risks

- Official installed `claude` is unavailable on this host, so official help/version comparison relies on Anthropic docs and npm metadata.
- Live print-mode behavior is blocked by missing login/credentials; no API call was attempted with secrets.
- Plugin command is implemented enough for basic list/marketplace/install subcommands, but interactive marketplace/plugin UI remains not fully parity-smoked.
- Auth status/logout and login argument validation are covered; auth login live OAuth/token success flows are not fully exercised because they need operator credentials or broader mock seams.
- Current feature flag posture is intentionally conservative; disabled private/native/background surfaces were documented rather than revived.
- Project purge, remote-control, ultrareview, and auto-mode subcommands remain larger parity gaps that need separate design/safety passes.

## Next action

Repo is at a better verified checkpoint with green build, green full suite, clean fixtures, refreshed report, and refreshed bundle. Next continuation should either add focused temp-HOME tests for deeper permission-mode behavior / auth login OAuth mock seams, or plan a bounded dry-run-only `project purge` parity implementation before any destructive behavior.
